## Preface {.smaller}

> I want us to agree that this is a welcoming and inclusive environment, and though I'm the person in front of the room, we're all going to learn a little something from each other. And let's agree that we're gonna share at least one thing we learned today with someone else. Can we agree?

::: notes
I mentioned that this conference was mainly for R and Python users, but the name of the conference doesn't exactly make the relationship between Posit and R or Python clear. If you're not actively using R you may not have heard of them before. But if you know someone who uses R, there's a very good chance they use at least one of the tools or packages that Posit develops.

## Open source data science and libraries: Shared goals?

> "Our mission is to create open-source software for data science, scientific research, and technical communication. We do this to **enhance the production and consumption of knowledge by everyone, regardless of economic means.** ... We invest heavily in open-source development, education, and the community with the goal of serving knowledge creators 100 years from now."

# Outline for this talk

1.  posit's approach to creating community and inclusion (as a first-time conference attendee)
2.  Effective teaching and presentation strategies used at the conference
3.  Showing off the ease and awesomeness of creating instructional materials using Quarto 💪
4.  Some highlights from the conference talks

::: notes
I did not meet any librarians while I was there, and as far as I know none of the talk presenters were librarians.
:::

::: notes
I discovered while researching others' reactions to the conference that Posit paid for speakers to get coaching from [Articulation Inc.](https://www.articulationinc.com)

About posit::conf(2023)
:::

::: notes
I was able to go to the conference thanks to the Winebrenner award. This was the first time I'd applied for an award, and I'd highly recommend any FTNTTs considering applying for the award to do so. One thing that made me more comfortable with the idea of applying is knowing that the committee's attitude is that they *want* to give out award funding; they're not approaching applications with the assumption that it's a no until proven a yes.

:::

::: notes
Since this was my first conference, some of what I thought was unique to positconf is standard practice at other conferences. They gave us buttons to indicate preference with physical contact. Lanyard colors to indicate do/do not photograph. Badges with name, pronouns. Information about gender-neutral bathrooms, lactation rooms, meditation rooms repeated at the start of each day of the workshops and conference.

-   Name and preferred pronouns on badges

-   Red lanyards = do not photograph

-   "Pac man stance" = leave room in conversation circles for someone to join

-   Optional buttons to indicate physical contact preferences

-   Gender neutral bathrooms, lactation rooms, meditation/prayer rooms

-   Thirty minute breaks every 90 minutes + 90 minute lunch break

# 3. What is Quarto and why it's amazing

## What is Quarto?

-   [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) is a next-gen tool for authoring documents and publications that incorporate narrative, code, and output (succeeds [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/))
-   Capable of producing "traditional" scholarly publications and presentations as well as "less-traditional" formats, like websites and blogs
-   Output to HTML, PDF, or Word in most cases
-   Can render not just R code, but other languages used for data science -- like Python, Julia, SQL, and more -- *all in the same document*
-   See also: [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/)

## Quarto was *everywhere* at positconf

-   Quarto was unveiled at last year's conference, so this was its "first birthday" (of sorts)
-   Lots of new features being added + lots of success stories from teams who successfully adopted it to improve shared documentation and onboarding
-   Virtually all of the presenters created their slides using Quarto and most shared the \*.qmd contents publically

# You should try Quarto! (Seriously!)

You don't have to write any R or Python code to create beautiful documents using Quarto! In most situations, you can use Quarto as a substitute for Microsoft Word or PowerPoint. Including writing manuscripts for publication (it works with Zotero!)

# 3. Let's show off some things Quarto can do that would be impossible (or at least annoying) to do in MS Word

## Quarto makes it easy to do web accessibility right the first time, without extra effort

For example, it's extremely easy to tell if an image lacks alt text and/or a text caption:

```         
![This is a figure caption](Pics/an-image.png){fig-alt="And this is alt text!"}

![](Pics/an-image.png){}
```

::: footer
Things Quarto can do
:::

## Simple and straightforward to add publication metadata

Quarto documents use *YAML front matter* to declare metadata at the top of each file. Here's an excerpt of what the YAML looks like for this document:

## Write equations using LaTeX markup

Recall the formula for a simple linear regression model:

$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x + \epsilon
$$ {#eq-lm}

where $\beta_0$ is the intercept and $\beta_1$ is the slope parameter. Suppose we want to estimate the relationship between college students' typical amount of sleep and how much they study, i.e.

$$
\mathrm{SleepTime} = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1\mathrm{StudyTime} + e
$$ {#eq-lm2}

#| echo: false

#' Import SPSS Tutorials sample data
mydata <- haven::read_spss("Sample_Dataset_2019.sav")

Things Quarto can do
:::

## Easily reference equations, tables, figures

In R, we can estimate the parameters of @eq-lm2 using the function `lm()`:

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::opts_chunk$set(decimals=2)
options(digits=2)
```

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| code-overflow: wrap
#| code-line-numbers: true
#| cache: true

#' Linear regression (uses base R)
fit_lm <- lm(SleepTime ~ StudyTime, 
             data=mydata)
```

::: columns
::: {.column width="65%"}

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| label: tbl-lm

sjPlot::tab_model(fit_lm, 
                  show.ci=FALSE,

                  show.obs=FALSE)
```

::: {.fragment .column width="35%"}
We see from @tbl-lm that the estimated slope parameter is **`r coef(fit_lm)[[2]]`**.

### What I took from my favorite talks

::: incremental
-   Learning challenging material is easier when you incorporate something you like
-   Learning challenging material is easier when you develop relationships with other learners and share knowledge
